# CS_Final_Project
CS Final Project for Intermediate Computing In Python. 


The project I decided to do for the final was a website that I called: The Chatty Bird. The main purpose of this website would be able to create new opportunites for people who want to connect with others through shared ideas, hobbies, passions, etc. With a minimalist design, the website's main purpose is to be a hub for people to create and attend meetups specific to their location. If you live in New York, you won't be recommended meetups that are taking place in California. Some of the main features of the website include: An RSVP/Find Meetup button where users can find meetups they want to attend, A Create Meetup button where users can create a meetup. Rotating conversations starters for users to take as inspiration, A Post of the day that features a positive experience a user as had in real life that has garnered a lot of attention, and a map feature that displayes meetups happening around them. I've been seeing a lot of sentiment recently about how people wish there were more 3rd spaces and that they wish they had more connections with others. The goal of The Chatty Bird is to spark a social movement for more in-person connections so we aren't always on our phones all the time. I think this website could help a lot of people! 

This project includes: HTML, CSS, Python, and some JavaScript
