CS Final Project. 


For my final project I wanted to create a website where people whould be able 
to connect with others through shared hobbies, intrests, and passions! I called
it The Chatty Bird. Some of the features that are in this are: A rotating 
conversation page, a create meetup tab, a map that shows where meetups are 
happening near them, and an rsvp for meetup function. The minimalist design of 
the website is purposeful and is supposed to encourage others to not spend 
too much time on the website, but more time in-person with others. I found 
that there was a growing sentiment of others feeling like they want to make 
more connections with others but don't always know how.  



This project uses a lot of HTML, CSS, some Javascript and Python. Although 
I didn't use too much python, a lot of the problem solving skills that I have 
learned this semester through this class was incorporated in this project.


I also was able to launch the website using github pages. Here is the link: https://ss7025.github.io/CS_Final_Project/
